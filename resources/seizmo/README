SEIZMO - passive seismology toolbox for Matlab & GNU Octave

1. What is SEIZMO?
------------------
A set of routines that taken together can aid in learning seismology as
well as reduce the effort required in day-to-day processing and analysis in
seismology research.  See the project website for more details:
 http://epsc.wustl.edu/~ggeuler/codes/m/seizmo/

2. Downloading
--------------
2a Get the latest version (as a compressed tarball or zipfile) here:
      https://github.com/g2e/seizmo/archive/master.tar.gz
      https://github.com/g2e/seizmo/archive/master.zip
2b Or grab an older tagged version: https://github.com/g2e/seizmo/tags
2c Or if you have git installed (http://git-scm.com/), you may use it to
   retrieve the latest version:
      git clone git://github.com/g2e/seizmo.git
   and to update to the latest version (within the seizmo directory):
      git pull git://github.com/g2e/seizmo.git

3. Installation
---------------
3a If you went with route 2a or 2b then extract the tarball/zipfile
   somewhere on your filesystem.  Next, go into the extracted directory
   and start Matlab or GNU Octave.  Finally, run install_seizmo in Matlab
   or GNU Octave.  This function will remove any paths from previous
   SEIZMO installs and add paths for the current SEIZMO as needed.  Drop me
   a note if you are having trouble with the install.
3b If you went the git route (2c) then move into your new repository
   and open Matlab or GNU Octave.  Next, run install_seizmo in Matlab or
   GNU Octave.  NOTE: You should run install_seizmo even if you are only
   updating using git because SEIZMO's directory layout changes from time
   to time and Matlab & GNU Octave need to be made aware of this.  There
   may be issues during the uninstall phase with git-based updates so you
   might need to clean your path occasionally.

3.1 If you can't download through Matlab and are on Linux/Unix/OSX, you may
    run the bash script setup_seizmo.bash via a terminal to download and
    unpackage external tools for seizmo.

3.2 If you can't or don't want to save seizmo to your paths, you can use
    startup_seizmo and shutdown_seizmo to dynamically use seizmo when you
    want.  This is also useful when the functions in seizmo have the same
    name as functions in another package that you are using.

4. Getting Started
------------------
4a In Matlab: Type 'help seizmo' in the Matlab command window.  Follow
   the hyperlinks as desired.
4b In Octave: Type 'help <function>' where <function> is the function you
   want help with.  There is currently no over-arching help for seizmo in
   GNU Octave because this requires significant effort making info files.

REMEMBER: 'help <function>' or 'help <directory>'
   ex. help install_seizmo
       help cmt
