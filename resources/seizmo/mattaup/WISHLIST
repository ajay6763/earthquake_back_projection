for me
- smash any bugs since latest release
- taupwavefront
for upstream
- taup applet needs to have path interpolation for core-diffracted waves
- path wave type ... like an isshear field
- path wave type conversion ... like an isconvert field
- path leg name field (w/ values like 'P' 'K' 'I' '^660')
