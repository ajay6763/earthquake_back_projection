%   PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE ALTERED MATTAUP SIGNIFICANTLY.  I WOULD
%   ARGUE THAT THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN FRUITFUL, BUT IF YOU NEED
%   COMPATIBILITY WITH THE ORIGINAL MATTAUP WRITTEN BY QIN LI THEN
%   YOU NEED TO LOOK ON THE INTERNET SOME MORE FOR THAT VERSION.
%
%   TO INSTALL:
%   1 - These scripts require the included files:
%          mattaup/lib/*.jar
%       to be added in Matlab's javaclasspath.  You may use the functions
%       javaaddpath and javarmpath to alter the dynamic portion of the path
%       or you will need to add the jar file to the Matlab system file
%       'classpath.txt'.  Use the command 'edit classpath.txt' in Matlab to
%       add the the jar file (be careful and use the full path!).  This may
%       require administrator privileges.
%
%   2 - To install the scripts in Matlab, add this directory to the Matlab
%       path.  You may do this by using Matlab functions addpath, rmpath,
%       and savepath.  This can be done graphically in Matlab by going to
%       File => Set Path.  Setting the path may require administrative
%       privileges.
%
%   3 - Type 'help mattaup' in Matlab to check if step 2 worked.  Run some
%       of the m-file functions listed to check if step 1 worked.
