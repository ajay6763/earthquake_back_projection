Currently, I think r2006b and later are well
supported.  There may be some minor issues
but nothing too worrisome.  Matlab 7.1 or
later is a must.  Below is my list of changes
to Matlab & Octave that can cause compatibility
issues.

Prior to 7.8 (R2009a):
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. no delaunay triangulation objects
	- this only affects princeton model interpolation so far
	- method for older versions is included (but far slower)


Prior to 7.3 (R2006b):
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. struct assignment bug (back to R14)
#############################################################
% Assigning only S(1).A should work, but does not.
x = S.A;
??? Illegal right hand side in assignment. Too many elements.
#############################################################
	affects:
	- unknown (can be worked around when found I think)
2. no unique 'first'/'last' flag
	affects:
	- 1D model codes


Prior to 7.2 (R2006a):
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. character encoding via fread/fwrite
	affects:
	- anything that uses '*char' will behave differently
2. no regexptranslate
	affects:
	- cmph, lh, qh, xdir (NO WILDCARDS!)


Prior to 7.1 (R14SP3):
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. isfield did not handle cell input
	affects:
	- lots... :(
2. cellfun did not handle functions
	affects:
	- seizmocheck
	- checkheader
3. (on solaris) graphics suck
	- menu does not work (menu with no text or buttons)
	- cursor position is offset by figure menus
4. divide by zero throws warning
5. logical on not 0 or 1 throws warning




Issues with Octave:
	- Plotting is an awful mess
	- Java support...
	- Does M_Map work?  No!
	- Help system... (no link support in terminal)
	- Needs profiler/mlint
	- struct view is too verbose
	- cell array of function handles should handle space separated (not require commas)
		- worked around?
	- way to assign new field to empty struct
		- worked around
	- setdiff does not handle mixed char/cell
		- does now? (worked around)
    - 3.8.0 dies after line continuatin & comment
