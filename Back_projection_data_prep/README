Before this data has to be organised such putting arrival marks based on a standard velocity model. Processing is same as done for MT5 stuff
After this put the files in corresponding array folders and then work on each folder according to following instructions. 

Scripts to prepare data for back projection in matlab

1. data_process.sh >> for visual inspection 

2.  cut_window.sh >> cut traces with respect to arrival at moment w.r.t to P arrival 30 seconds before and 150 seconds after can be changed inside the script

3. header_info.sh >> TO get header info of the files such as sampling frequecny to fix all the traces to same sampling frequency

4. decimation.sh >> decimate the file to a same sampling frequency

5. combine_header_info.sh >> combine header info to genrate a info file % just for the reference shake while working in matlab

5. prep_to_process_in_matlab.sh >> to convet rpocessd data to ascii format to be used in matlab
